# dlang
A quick-study site/blog for getting up and running with D in a minimal amount of time.
Because I hop from project to project, I need a way to quickly remind myself of the basics of whatever language I'll be working with. If you get some bennefit from this, please consider making a contribution to the cause. As alsways, feedback is welcome (see the bottom of whatever page you are reading) especially if I've missed something, committed a typo, or something needs clarification. (Chances are, if you don't catch on from what I wrote, next time I read it, I'll be confused, too.)
