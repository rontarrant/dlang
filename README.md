# dlang
A quick-study site/blog for getting up and running with D in a minimal amount of time.

Because I hop from project to project, I need a way to quickly remind myself of the basics of whatever language I'll be working with, thus this repo.

If you get some bennefit from this, please consider making a contribution to the cause (see the Sponsor button over there on the right).

As always, feedback is welcome (see the bottom of whatever page you are reading to leave a comment) especially if I've missed something, committed a typo, or something needs clarification. Chances are, if you don't catch on from what I wrote, next time I read it, I'll be confused, too.
